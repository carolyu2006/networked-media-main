        <h2>Artist? Designer? Developer? Or...</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Here is my creative journey ü§î </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>I started with drawing at middle school! </p>
        <img src="../images/art/art1.JPG" alt="Art" class="art-image" />
        <img src="../images/art/art2.JPG" alt="Art" class="art-image" />
        <img src="../images/art/art3.JPG" alt="Art" class="art-image" />


        <p>But I soon realized that I was so tallented in it because I am not the kind of artistic expression person (also that I don't know how to use visual art to express my thoughts and feelings. i dont know what to draw rather than just imitating). </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>I turned my focus to design and to explore new medias.  </p>
        <p>However, I realized that just designing will not give me the feeling that I am creating an IMPACT (which is a large part of what i want to achieve). Thus, in IMA I've got in touch to all different media resources and more coding. </p>

        <br/>
        <h2>Interactive Media & Programming</h2>
        <a href="https://carolyuuu.com/works" class="choice-link">View some of my projects</a>
        <p>While I aim for create projects that is useful(?) but I also enjoy creating some funny things.</p>
        <img src="../images/art/tech1.png" alt="Art" class="tech-image" />
        <img src="../images/art/tech2.png" alt="Art" class="tech-image" />
        <br/>
        <p>However, the emergence of AI made me doupt again. (aghhh i am so bad in focusing on one thing... but I am still exploring :) </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>NOW & FUTURE</h2>
        <p>Now, while I am still not sure what exactly, but I do hope to use technology as a skill to designa and create things or artistical things to make the world a better place. </p>
